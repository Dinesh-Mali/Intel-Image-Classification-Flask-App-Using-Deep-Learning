# Project - Intel-Image-Classification-Flask-App-Using-Deep-Learning

# Introduction
We will be working on Intel Images, i.e., images of building forest, street, etc.

We will build a convolutional neural network and train it on these images. This is a multi-class classification problem and we are solving this using keras.

# Project Flow

1) Load the data into pandas dataframe

2) Visualize the images we are working on

3) Converting images to numpy array and normalize it

4) Preprocessing data - checking class imbalanceness, performing one-hot-encoding, etc.

5) Creating model architecture and fitting it to our data

6) Finally analysing the model results on test data

7) Integrating the model as web app using Flask
